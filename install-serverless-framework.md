# Installing the Serverless Framework

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your local machine

## Step 1: Install the Serverless Framework

Use the following command to install the Serverless Framework globally on your local machine:

```
npm install -g serverless
```

## Step 2: Verify the installation

Use the following command to verify that the Serverless Framework has been installed correctly:

```
serverless --version
```

This should output the version number of the Serverless Framework that you have installed.

## Step 3: Create a new service

Use the following command to create a new service with the Serverless Framework:

```
serverless create --template aws-nodejs
```

This will create a new project with the basic file structure and configuration for a Node.js application on AWS.

## Step 4: Deploy your service

Use the following command to deploy your service to the specified cloud provider:

```
serverless deploy
```
