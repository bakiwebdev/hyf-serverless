1. Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local computer. This can be done by downloading the AWS CLI from the official AWS website.

2. Create an IAM user in AWS. The IAM user will be used to access and manage AWS services from the CLI tool. Make sure to provide the user with the appropriate permissions.

3. Configure the AWS CLI. This can be done by running “aws configure” in the command line. When prompted, enter the access key, secret key and the region of the AWS account.

4. Test the configuration by running “aws sts get-caller-identity” in the command line. This should return information about the IAM user that you created in the previous step.

5. You have now successfully set up the AWS CLI. You can now use the CLI to access and manage AWS services from the command line.
