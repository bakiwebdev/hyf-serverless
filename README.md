# Getting Started with Serverless Application
## Prerequisites

- [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with your AWS credentials
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed
- [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/)

## Step 1: Create a new project

Use the following command to create a new project with the Serverless Framework:

```
serverless create --template aws-nodejs
```

This will create a new project with the basic file structure and configuration for a Node.js application on AWS.

## Step 2: Define your functions

In the serverless.yml file, you can define your serverless functions under the functions property. Each function should have a handler property that specifies the file and exported function to be used as the entry point for the function.

Example:

```
functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
```

## Step 3: Define your events

Under each function, you can define the events that trigger the function using the events property.

Example:

```
functions:
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello
    events:
      - http:
          path: /
          method: GET
```

This example will create an API Gateway endpoint that will trigger the hello function when a GET request is made to the root path.

## Step 4: Deploy your application

Use the following command to deploy your application to AWS:

```
serverless deploy
```

This will create the necessary resources on AWS and deploy your functions. The command will output the endpoint URLs for your functions.

## Step 5: Test your application

Use the endpoint URLs to test your application and make sure everything is working as expected.

> Note: This is a basic example and it's possible that you'll need to add more configurations or resources depending on your specific use case.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your serverless application on the AWS platform.
